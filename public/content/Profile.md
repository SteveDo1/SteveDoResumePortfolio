## About
Hi there! My name is Steve Do, and I am a software developer with a passion for web development. I am a recent new graduate but have worked on a variety of projects that range from small websites to large-scale web applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, building custom keyboards, or playing League of Legends.
